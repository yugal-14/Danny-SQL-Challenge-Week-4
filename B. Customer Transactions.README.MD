###  1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?

```sql
SELECT txn_type,
       count(*) AS unique_count,
       sum(txn_amount) AS total_amont
FROM customer_transactions
GROUP BY txn_type;
``` 
	
#### Result set:

###  2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?

```sql
SELECT round(count(customer_id)/
               (SELECT count(DISTINCT customer_id)
                FROM customer_transactions)) AS average_deposit_count,
       concat('$', round(avg(txn_amount), 2)) AS average_deposit_amount
FROM customer_transactions
WHERE txn_type = "deposit";
```

###  3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?

```sql
WITH transaction_count_per_month_cte AS
  (SELECT customer_id,
          month(txn_date) AS txn_month,
          SUM(IF(txn_type="deposit", 1, 0)) AS deposit_count,
          SUM(IF(txn_type="withdrawal", 1, 0)) AS withdrawal_count,
          SUM(IF(txn_type="purchase", 1, 0)) AS purchase_count
   FROM customer_transactions
   GROUP BY customer_id,
            month(txn_date))
SELECT txn_month,
       count(DISTINCT customer_id) as customer_count
FROM transaction_count_per_month_cte
WHERE deposit_count>1
  AND (purchase_count = 1
       OR withdrawal_count = 1)
GROUP BY txn_month;
```

###  4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?

```sql
WITH txn_monthly_balance_cte AS
  (SELECT customer_id,
          txn_amount,
          month(txn_date) AS txn_month,
          SUM(CASE
                  WHEN txn_type="deposit" THEN txn_amount
                  ELSE -txn_amount
              END) AS net_transaction_amt
   FROM customer_transactions
   GROUP BY customer_id,
            month(txn_date)
   ORDER BY customer_id)
SELECT customer_id,
       txn_month,
       net_transaction_amt,
       sum(net_transaction_amt) over(PARTITION BY customer_id
                                     ORDER BY txn_month ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS closing_balance
FROM txn_monthly_balance_cte;
```
